     <div class="grid_4 one"><img src="/images/world_cup.png" class="center" alt="world_cup"/><h2>world cup</h2>The ICC Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the "flagship event of the international cricket calendar" by the ICC.The World Cup is open to all members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), although the highest-ranking teams receive automatic qualification.</div>
     <div class="grid_4 one"><img src="/images/location.jpg" class="center" alt="location"/><h2>location</h2>From its formation, the ICC had Lord's Cricket Ground as its home, and from 1993 had its offices in the "Clock Tower" building at the nursery end of the ground. The ICC was funded by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of ODI cricket. As not all Member countries had double-tax agreements with the United Kingdom, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC Development (International) Pvt Ltd – known as IDI. This was established in 1994.For the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair.</div>
    <div class="grid_4 one"><img src="/images/income.jpeg" class="center" alt="income"/><h2>income</h2>The ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the Cricket World Cup, and it distributes the majority of that income to its members. Sponsorship and television rights of the World Cup brought in over US$1.6 billion between 2007 and 2015, by far the ICC's main source of income. In the nine-month accounting period to 31 December 2007 the International cricket Council had operating income of USD 12.66 million, mainly from member subscriptions and sponsorship. In contrast, event income was USD 285.87 million, including USD 239 million from the 2007 World Cup.</div>
